# Light Controller

Written: Fall 2009

This is Atmel AVR code (ATTiny13?) to control the LED houseplant lights in my windowless (!)
bedroom in New York.  With no input, the lights remain on.Before going to sleep you press a 
button and the lights turn off for a preset amount of time (based on a setting in EEPROM).  
After that time the lights slowly fade in.

The circuit for this was hacked together on a breadboard with parts from around the house
 so unfortunately I don't have schematics.
